            <p>Ever hear what sounded like really good training advice, only to find it ineffective when you put it to
                use? Success is fun, but failure is a tough pill to swallow, especially when the same advice method
                worked for others.</p>
            <p>Listening to a world class bodybuilder recently, he described his secret to success in that he "trained
                five hours a day, every day, and never skipped a day." When I was in my teen years, such advice would
                have sent me headlong into a workout frenzy for days on end, only to be disappointed when injury,
                illness, or burn out would put an end to my string of five hour workouts.</p>
            <h5>Body Type Matters</h5>
            <p>At the point of failing in application of 'expert' training principles, I came to realize a very
                important point. Elite athletes have elite genetics and elite body types. It is ludicrous to think that
                their training should apply to my life, my situation, my genetics, my body type.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;">Our training failures have more to do with
                        applying methods not built for us than for lack of effort or desire.</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Regardless of my age, current sport, or fitness goal, the most important element of self awareness in
                training has always been body type. When I got it right, my training would fit my genetic code and my
                results would soar. When I got it wrong, it was like trying to put a round training peg into a square
                genetic hole, frustration and failure followed.</p>
            <h5>Classifying Body Types</h5>
            <p>Any effort to identify distinct body types faces certain challenge. Every person has a unique genetic
                composition, with physical implications. The study of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotype_and_constitutional_psychology">somatotyping</a> ,
                with its origins in 1960's pyschological research of William H. Sheldon, classified body types into
                three groups along a spectrum; ectomorph, endomorph, and mesomorph.</p>
            <p>The first fruits of these classifications were related to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_stereotype" title="Ethnic stereotype">cultural
                    stereotypes</a>. One study found that endomorphs are likely to be perceived as slow, sloppy, and
                lazy. Mesomorphs, in contrast, are typically stereotyped as popular and hardworking, whereas ectomorphs
                are often viewed as intelligent but fearful.</p>
            <p>While each of the three groups of body is determined <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotype_and_constitutional_psychology">by calculations</a>,
                it is possible to understand these classes largely by the characteristics of each. Ben Creicos has
                compiled <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/becker3.htm">nine questions to calculate estimated
                    body type</a>. A few important criteria from Creicos' analysis are summarized in the following
                table:</p>

            <p>The result of Creicos' calculation offers the individual insight to which body types are prevalent in
                their genetic structure. In my case, for example, my dominant score was endomorph (63%) with a lesser

            <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
            <h6>Avoid One Size Fits All Solutions</h6>
            <p>Over my lifetime I cannot count the number of one-size fits all solutions that have come and gone. There
                is no one diet for everyone, and there certainly is no one strength and endurance training program for
                everyone. Who you are matters, and you need a diet and exercise program that is designed for you, your
                body, your genetic code, your present physical condition. When you see a one-size fits all solution, be
                skeptical and embrace only those things which are compatible with your body type.</p>
            <h6>Things Can Change</h6>
            <p>Various factors, including age, can affect your body type. A diligent approach to training requires us
                all to be monitoring the scale, the mirror, and our dimensions. This has been true in my own experience.
                When I was 15 years old I had a growth spurt, shooting up from 5'10" to 6'5" in less than nine months. I
                went from a full-body 14 year old to a string bean at 6'5", my weight staying near 165 pounds at both
                heights. I went from mesomorph to ectomorph in a year. As we age and our lifestyles gravitate toward
                sedentary behavior, our bodies tend toward the endomorph. A lifetime of training calls for a lifetime of
                awareness and diligence as our bodies go through hormonal changes with age.</p>
            <h6>Get Some Help</h6>
            <p>Determining where you stand on the spectrum from ectomorph to endomorph requires a bit more than looking
                at a few pictures, descriptions, or questions on a short survey. It also involves how your body reacts
                to different forms of nutrition and training. In order to reach your highest potential, reach out to a
                qualified personal trainer today.</p>
