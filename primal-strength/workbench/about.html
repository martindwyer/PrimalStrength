                <p><strong><em>Primal Strength</em></strong> represents the accumulated knowledge and experience of
                    Martin Dwyer. Martin has been a member of <a href="https://www.issaonline.edu/"><em>The
                            International Sports Sciences Association</em></a> (ISSA) since 2016 where he holds the
                    qualifications of <em><strong>Certified </strong><strong><em>F</em>itness Trainer</strong></em>
                    (CFT) and <em><strong>Certified Specialist in <em>Strength and C</em>onditioning</strong></em>
                    (CSSC). The ISSA, founded in 1988 as one of the first self-regulating organizations for personal
                    trainers, is the first and only fitness organization in the U.S. accredited by a federally
                    recognized agency. Members of ISSA agree to follow the organizations <a
                        href="https://www.issatrainer.com/policies/professional-standards-of-personal-training/">Professional
                        Standards</a> and be subject to review of the organization's ethics committee.</p>
                <h4><strong>Youth Sports and Fitness</strong></h4>
                <p>Martin's desire for athletic performance can be traced to his earliest years, and throughout his life
                    strength training, running and cycling, basketball and baseball have played important roles each and
                    every year. In high school, Martin played baseball and basketball at the AAU level, and lettered in
                    both sports. He received all conference honors in basketball as a Senior in a very competitive
                    conference. Several of Martin's friends and teammates from these years went on to collegiate
                    athletics and even professional sports.</p>
                <h4><strong>Collegiate Strength Training</strong></h4>
                <p>After high school, Martin would find his way to NCAA Division III Millikin University in Decatur,
                    Illinois, where he participated in the basketball and baseball programs. He credits the diet and
                    nutrition program at Millikin as his first experience with serious growth in strength and muscle
                    mass. He arrived on campus a very lean 6'5" and 185 pounds. His coaches prescribed a diet high in
                    protein and healthy fats, along with lots of bench presses, squats, and deadlifts. Just a year later
                    he was listed in the program at strong and athletic 6'5", 215 pounds. This season of strength
                    training gave birth to a life long passion.</p>
                <h4><strong>Successful in Business</strong></h4>
                <p>Martin's competitive spirit served him well in corporate America. After finishing his B.S. in
                    Business at Millikin, Martin completed a M.S. at Illinois State University and would take his
                    competitive spirit to corporate America. Over 20 years he would work exclusively with Fortune 100
                    companies in leadership positions with ever growing areas of responsibility. At his highest level,
                    Senior Vice President of a super regional bank, he managed over 150 employees and 20 branches.</p>
                <h4><strong>Coaching Youth Sports</strong></h4>
                <p>During his time in corporate life, Martin was active coaching and leading youth sports and programs.
                    He has volunteered in various capacities for programs at the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, and the
                    Salvation Army.</p>

                            sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Staying fit through life can be a challenge,
                    especially in the face of illness and injury. After recovering from serious illness in 2009,
                    Martin's dedication to fitness would grow tremendously as he faced the challenge with his health.
                    Today, after recovering fully, Martin devotes his days to encouraging and guiding others in their
                    wellness journeys. His approach to fitness is committed to building core strength with progressive
                    resistance weight training, balanced with an appropriate level of cardio for individual needs.</p>
                <p>In addition to his training, Martin also attends to the needs of <a href="https://mdbytes.com">MD
                        Web Technologies</a>, his web development company.</p>
