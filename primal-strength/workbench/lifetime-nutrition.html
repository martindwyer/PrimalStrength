            <p>I was a skinny kid and pretty much what they call a <a href="https://www.hardgainer.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">hardgainer</a>.  It took me years to gain strength.   For most of my training years,
                I
                took the 'skinny' me for granted and focused on building strength and size.  I had a powerful lesson
                that I
                would learn:
                <blockquote style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">"What you take for

            <div class="col-md-10">

                <p>I was beyond strong by any standard for my years, but the lack of focus on nutrition was begging for
                    attention.  Pictures like this one (taken a few years ago) appeared more and more often, and I knew
                    something had to be done.  Things had gotten out of control, with 39% body fat with over 80 pounds
                    to
                    lose to reach, any semblance of normal weight seemed almost out of sight.  I had lost weight before,
                    in
                    years past, mostly as a result of severe caloric deprivation.</p>

                <p>But I knew if I was going to lose weight, it had to be a permanent change and not simply a matter of
                    seasonal deprivation.  I set about looking for a program that would meet the following requirements:
                </p>
                <ul style="font-size: 125%; margin: 20px 0px;">
                    <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Provide high quality sources of protein to maintain and keep
                            improving my strength training.</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Offer a starting point that accelerates weight loss, turning the
                            body into a fat-burning machine.</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Gradually adjusts as weight loss needs subside.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>After much reading, combined with my prior many cycles of attempting to lose weight permanently, I
                    finally committed to the <a href="https://www.atkins.com/">Atkins Nutritional Approach</a>.  The
                    results
                    were astounding: over 80 pounds of weight lost and body fat percentage cut in half - in under six
                    months.  I lost 14 inches off my waist and my prior strength levels had all either been maintained
                    or
                    improved.</p>

                <p>Being thrilled with my weight loss, and now having maintained that weight with Atkins for almost 18
                    months, I wanted to share some of the research that compelled me toward this approach along with my
                    personal experience.</p>

            <h4>Atkins is Ketogenic</h4>
            <p>I needed to burn fat, and when your body burns fat for fuel (a process called <em>lipolysis</em>) it
                produces active agents called <em>ketones</em>  to act as energy in your body.  Anyone looking to burn
                fat
                will have <em>ketones</em> in their system.  They are a perfectly natural part of the process of burning
                fat. When your body is producing <em>ketones</em> for fuel it is said to be in a state of
                <em>ketosis</em>. 
                Any process such as diet, fasting, or starvation, that results in fat-burning and <em>ketone</em>
                production
                is said to be <em>ketogenic</em>.<br /><br />

                Dr. Atkins founded the Atkins diet on volumes of medical research.  His desire was, through diet and
                exercise produce a state in which the body naturally turns to burning fat. In his words, this can
                all be
                summarized:</p>
            <blockquote>"The Atkins nutritional approach stimulates the process of lipolysis, a state I hope you are
                always in: burning your fat for energy. A secondary process of lipolysis is ketosis. Ketosis occurs
                when
                you are taking in a low level of carbohydrates from the food you eat, as you will during the
                Induction
                phase of Atkins. Lipolysis results in the creation of ketones (that's ketosis), a perfectly normal
                and
                natural function of the body." Robert C Atkins MD, <em>New Diet Revolution, 3rd Edition (1992)</em>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In today's world people attempt to make distinctions where they unfortunately do not exist. 
                Atkins,<a href="https://www.atkins.com/how-it-works/compare-diets"> in their response to certain
                    'keto' diet
                    challengers</a>, suggests that "Atkins is a better ketogenic diet. On Atkins you get more food
                choices
                and eat a greater balance of macronutrients."  <a
                    href="https://files.atkins.com/Atkins_KetoInfographic.pdf">Atkins is ketogenic</a>.
                <h4>Atkins Changes With Your Needs</h4>
                Carbohydrate restriction is the only mandate in the Atkins Nutritional Approach.  How much?  Well,
                again, it
                depends on your needs.  From his earliest work in 1972, Atkins recommended four phases which
                continue
                pretty
                much unaltered almost 50 years later.  They are summarized here.</p>

            <p><strong>Phase 1: Induction</strong>.  This is when you help your body switch from burning carbs to
                fat.
                This
                process is called <em>ketosis</em>, and you should notice weight loss quickly. You’ll eat protein,
                fat,
                and
                only 20 grams of carbs in veggie form daily.   At this point, your carb sources should consist
                primarily
                of
                low <em>glycemic index</em> vegetables like broccoli, spinach, brussell sprouts, green peppers,
                onions,
                asparagus, and nearly all types of lettuce.  Make no mistake, these meals should be filled with
                delicious
                meats and vegetables.<br /><br />

                <a
                    href="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dish-meal-food-salad-produce-meat-lunch-cuisine-steak-vegetables-beef-tenderloin-rib-eye-steak-roast-beef-bbq-steak-rib-eye-animal-source-foods-sirloin-steak-706216-1.jpg"><img
                        class="alignnone wp-image-631 size-full"
                        src="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dish-meal-food-salad-produce-meat-lunch-cuisine-steak-vegetables-beef-tenderloin-rib-eye-steak-roast-beef-bbq-steak-rib-eye-animal-source-foods-sirloin-steak-706216-1.jpg"
                        alt="" width="1200" height="630" /></a>

                It is understood that carb totals should exclude dietary fiber.  One cup of broccoli, as an
                example,
                contains 6 grams of carbohydrate but this total includes 2.4 grams of dietary fiber.  Because
                dietary
                fiber
                has no affect on blood glucose levels, it is deducted from the total.  <strong>Net carbs</strong>
                for
                one
                cup of broccoli would be 6 minus 2.4, or 3.6 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />

                During this phase your body should be shedding pounds quickly at the start.  If you're not coming to
                Atkins
                with a severe weight loss problem, or you prefer vegan nutrition sources, then you could begin
                Atkins at
                Phase 2.</p>

            <p><strong>Phase 2: Ongoing Weight Loss</strong>.  After water weight and initial weight loss, with
                regular
                exercise, your weight loss should stabilize in the 1 to 4 pounds per week range.  In my case, when I
                am
                in
                Phase 1 I plan very specifically on 3 to 4 pounds per week.  If my losses deviate from that much I
                look
                at
                my food and exercise journals to see where changes can be made.  During this time of close weekly
                monitoring, increases in carbohydrate can also be made to the extent that ongoing weight loss
                continues.
                <br /><br />

                <a href="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/market-3351062_1920.jpg"><img
                        class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1138"
                        src="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/market-3351062_1920.jpg" alt=""
                        width="1920" height="1157" /></a>

                As time passes you enter Phase 2, with net carbs in the 25 to 50 gram range per day.  Carbohydrates
                remain
                in the low glycemic index category, but they get much more exciting.  Foods like strawberries and
                Greek
                Yogurt become within range here and you are encouraged to enjoy them while monitoring their affect
                on
                your
                weight loss progress.  Keep in mind that, should carbs in your diet reverse the process of ketosis
                currently
                under way, it may take three to four days to see this process boosted back into action.</p>

            <p><strong>Phase 3: Pre-Maintenance</strong>. As you reach within 10 pounds of your goal weight, you
                pass
                into
                phase 3, a time dedicated to getting familiar with your bodies ongoing reaction to adding carbs to
                your
                daily diet.  In this phase, it is normally expected that carbs should be in the range of 50 to 80
                grams
                per
                day.  Foods with moderate glycemic index, such as apples, pears, carrots, potatoes, and whole
                grains,
                can
                also be carefully added back into the diet.<br /><br />

                <a href="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/grain-bread-3135224_1920.jpg"><img
                        class="aligncenter wp-image-1141 size-full"
                        src="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/grain-bread-3135224_1920.jpg" alt=""
                        width="1920" height="1086" /></a>

                In my case phase 3 is the most important phase.  It is during phase 3 that 'normal life' should begin
                to
                take shape cautiously keeping in mind that errors with too many carbs put an end to ongoing fat
                burning. 
                Errors such as this take days to overcome.</p>

            <p><strong>Phase 4: Maintenance</strong>.  When the target weight has been reached, Atkins recommends a
                long-term target of carbs in the 80 to 100 gram range as long as it does not affect your weight.
                During
                the
                maintenance phase it is possible to make mistakes, and you will need to adjust for those mistakes
                accordingly.<br /><br />

                <a href="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_9519.jpg"><img
                        class="size-full wp-image-1072"
                        src="https://pswp.mdbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_9519.jpg" alt="" width="2048"
                        height="2048" /></a>

                Over the recent holiday season, I went a little overboard with the liberty provided in this phase of
                the
                diet and gained over 10 pounds.  I returned to phase 1 of the program and in a short time I was back
                on
                track for long-term success.  Once you've completed a weight loss cycle, you will find it easier to
                occasionally return to prior phases on an as needed basis.</p>

            <p><em>This post represents a culmination of my personal journey to controlled carb living.  Atkins, as
                    well
                    as
                    other ketongenic diets, may or may not be for every reader.  Atkins may not be suited for you if
                    you
                    are
                    diabetic, pre-diabetic, or have heart, liver, or kidney dysfunction of any kind.  You should
                    have
                    approval of your doctor before pursuing any new dietary program. </em></p>
